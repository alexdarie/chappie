This paper motivates the need for modelling the influence of weather over fitness habits so that important patterns can be observed and refined in real-time. In addition to well established data mining techniques, I summarized useful insights from related papers and articles. Furthermore, several cloud services for mining data streams are presented, as well as describing the technologies involved in collecting weather data, such as 3D printing and edge computing. Additional observations were made regarding trends and the financial involvement of big technological companies into certain technologies and areas of research. This work is the result of my own activity. I have neither given nor received unauthorized assistance on this work.
