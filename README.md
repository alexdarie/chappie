## Exploring the Weather Influence on Fitness Habits Using Data Mining Tools

My bachelor thesis studied data mining tools for determining the weather influence on fitness habits, having its backbone built on top of GCP, to achieve asynchronous messaging, real-time retraining of statistical models, and data streams processing. 

The results were visualized on a mobile application, while the hardware components were integrated into a custom-made chassis printed on a Prusa machine. A weather station was built for this project to provide accurate data sets.
