## Exploring the weather influence on fitness habits using data mining tools

This paper motivates the need for modelling the influence of weather over fitness habits so that important patterns can be observed and refined in real-time. The software solution was built on top of large scale, cloud services, coupled with a distributed system and custom data source points - physical devices modeled and printed on a Prusa machine. In the proposed approached were covered both the architecture design and the results obtained through statistical analysis, inspired from related work. Additional observations were made regarding trends and related work on the market predisposition of investing in wellness and fitness products that require data mining.
