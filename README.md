## Exploring the Weather Influence on Fitness Habits Using Data Mining Tools

To the best of my knowledge, the influence of weather on fitness habits has not been studied intensively, so that I approached the open problem, building an infrastructure capable of real-time communication, with a large throughput of data and reliable persistence capabilities. Using Google Cloud Services, open-source hardware such as Pimoroni's series of sensors, the Raspberry Pi computational power, a framework capable to generate non-native mobile applications, additive manufacturing, and internet accessible machines running the backend servers, represents our original approach.

The real-time retraining process of statistical models was achieved through the combination of Cloud BigQuery ML capabilities and the Cloud Dataflow data processing. Furthermore, real-time data visualization was based on the Cloud PubSub messaging features, using the publisher-subscriber approach, coupled with a producer-consumer solution for message ingestion at the mobile application level.
