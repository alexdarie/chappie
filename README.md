## Exploring the Weather Influence on Fitness Habits Using Data Mining Tools

To the best of my knowledge, the influence of weather on fitness habits has not been studied intensively, so that I approached the open problem, building an infrastructure capable of real-time communication, with a large throughput of data and reliable persistence capabilities. Using Google Cloud Services, open-source hardware such as Pimoroni's series of sensors, the Raspberry Pi computational power, a framework capable to generate non-native mobile applications, additive manufacturing, and internet accessible machines running the backend servers, made this approach to be considered original.

The real-time retraining process of statistical models was achieved through the combination of Cloud BigQuery ML capabilities and the Cloud Dataflow data processing. Furthermore, real-time data visualization was based on the Cloud PubSub messaging features, using the publisher-subscriber approach, coupled with a producer-consumer solution for message ingestion at the mobile application level.

Centering the whole weight of this project on one particular feature makes it incredibly difficult to describe and develop, yet someone's habits are no miracle and they can be inferred without using a mobile application. Nevertheless, the reason behind building it is to help athletes that are not aware of their behavior. Those being said, in the fitness habits panel we start from a comparison chart, which visually describes the differences between the current weather status and someone's habits. If a potential user has any doubts, under the chart are listed the most recent five or fewer activities, depending on the activity type. Furthermore, if the decision should imply data reasoning, then one can make a decision based on its preferences numerically depicted in the left upper side of the first slide, the number of km predicted for a certain hour of the day, its probability to engage in any fitness activity for that day, or the overall statistics for the given season. The final slide of the habits panel describes data recorded up to 1 year ago, also stating the error in prediction in a human-readable format. It was meant to give information on the model accuracy over time. In order to trust a tool, it has to be clear how far it can go at any point in time. Knowing the prediction error is not something that only the developers should know, as someone's health might be influenced by these predictions.
