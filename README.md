## Exploring the Weather Influence on Fitness Habits Using Data Mining Tools

This paper motivates the need for modeling the influence of weather over fitness habits so that important patterns can be observed and enhanced in real-time. The software solution was built on top of large scale cloud services, coupled with a distributed system and custom data source points - physical devices modeled and printed on a Prusa machine. In the proposed approach we covered both the architecture design and the results obtained through statistical analysis, inspired from related work. Additional observations were accomplished regarding trends and the market predisposition of investing in wellness and fitness products that require data mining. 

To the best of our knowledge, the influence of weather on fitness habits has not been studied intensively, so that we approached the open problem, building an infrastructure capable of real-time communication, with a large throughput of data and reliable persistence capabilities. Using Google Cloud Services, open-source hardware such as Pimoroni's series of sensors, the Raspberry Pi computational power, a framework capable to generate non-native mobile applications, additive manufacturing, and internet accessible machines running the backend servers, represents our original approach. 

The real-time retraining process of statistical models was achieved through the combination of Cloud BigQuery machine learning capabilities and the Cloud Dataflow data overview. Furthermore, real-time data visualization was based on the Cloud PubSub messaging features, using the publisher-subscriber approach, coupled with a producer-consumer solution for message ingestion at the mobile application level.
